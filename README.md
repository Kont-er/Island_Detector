# A General-Use Neural Network for Extracting Patterns from Images

This repository contains everything you need to train and predict patterns in images, as well as a web app for preparing training data and visualizing results.

## Current Use Case
The neural network is currently trained on images of islands surrounded by the sea, identifying:
- **Upper border:** Often trees or foliage.
- **Bottom border:** Beaches or shorelines.

However, this versatile model can be trained on virtually any set of images with a common feature, such as:
- Eye shapes
- Facial expressions
- Highway traffic signs
